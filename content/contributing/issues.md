Before putting in lots of work on a creating a new feature or enhancing
an existing one, please file an issue in the respective project for discussion.
It could be the case there are technical issues to be figured out first, and
we just don't want to see effort going to waste.

For simple documentation improvements / typo fixes by all means open a PR
and someone will merge it soon.

Bug reports are always welcome, especially when enough information is provided
to reproduce the problem.
